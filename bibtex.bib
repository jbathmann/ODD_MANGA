abstract = {When plants are competing, larger individuals often obtain a disproportionate share of the contested resources and suppress the growth of their smaller neighbors, a phenomenon called size-asymmetric competition. We review what is known about the mechanisms that give rise to and modify the degree of size asymmetry in competition among plants, and attempt to clarify some of the confusion in the literature on size asymmetry. We broadly distinguish between mechanisms determined primarily by characteristics of contested resource from those that are influenced by the growth and behavior of the plants themselves. To generate size asymmetric resource competition, a resource must be 'pre-emptable.' Because of its directionality, light is the primary, but perhaps not the only, example of a pre-emptable resource. The available data suggest that competition for mineral nutrients is often size symmetric (i.e., contested resources are divided in proportion to competitor sizes), but the potential role of patchily and/or episodically supplied nutrients in causing size asymmetry is largely unexplored. Virtually nothing is known about the size symmetry of competition for water. Plasticity in morphology and physiology acts to reduce the degree of size asymmetry in competition. We argue that an allometric perspective on growth, allocation, resource uptake, and resource utilization can help us understand and quantify the mechanisms through which plants compete.},

abstract = {Effects of flooding on water transport in mangroves have previously been investigated in a few studies, most of which were conducted on seedlings in controlled settings. In this study, we used heat-dissipation sap probes to determine if sap flow (Js) attenuates with radial depth into the xylem of mature trees of three south Florida mangrove species growing in Rookery Bay. This was accomplished by inserting sap probes at multiple depths and monitoring diurnal flow. For most species and diameter size class combinations tested, Js decreased dramatically beyond a radial depth of 2 or 4 cm, with little sap flow beyond a depth of 6 cm. Mean Js was reduced on average by 20{\%} in Avicennia germinans (L.) Stearn, Laguncularia racemosa (L.) Gaertn. f. and Rhizophora mangle L. trees when soils were flooded. Species differences were highly significant, with L. racemosa having the greatest midday Js of about 26 g H2O m-2 s-1 at a radial depth of 2 cm compared with a mean for the other two species of about 15 g H2O m-2s-1. Sap flow at a depth of 2 cm in mangroves was commensurate with rates reported for other forested wetland tree species. We conclude that: (1) early spring flooding of basin mangrove forests causes reductions in sap flow in mature mangrove trees; (2) the sharp attenuations in Js along the radial profile have implications for understanding whole-tree water use strategies by mangrove forests; and (3) regardless of flood state, individual mangrove tree water use follows leaf-level mechanisms in being conservative. {\textcopyright} 2007 Heron Publishing.},

The magnitude of xylem pressure potential (P x), the vulnerability of xylem to cavitation, the frequency of embolized vessels in situ, and the capacity of R. mangle to repair embolized vessels were evaluated with conventional and recently developed techniques. The osmotic potential of the interstitial soil water ($\pi$ sw) surrounding the roots of R. mangle was c.-2.6±5.52×10-3 and-0.4±6.13×10-3 MPa in the coastal and estuarine sites, respectively. Midday covered (non-transpiring) leaf water potentials ($\Psi$ L) determined with a pressure chamber were 0.6-0.8 MPa more positive than those of exposed, freely-transpiring leaves, and osmotic potential of the xylem sap ($\pi$ x) ranged from-0.1 to-0.3 MPa. Consequently, estimated midday values of P x (calculated by subtracting $\pi$ x from covered $\Psi$ L) were about 1 MPa more positive than $\Psi$ L determined on freely transpiring leaves. The differences in $\Psi$ L between covered and transpiring leaves were linearly related to the transpiration rates. The slope of this relationship was steeper for the coastal site, suggesting that the hydraulic resistance was larger in leaves of coastal R. mangle plants. This was confirmed by both hydraulic conductivity measurements on stem segments and high-pressure flowmeter studies made on excised leafy twigs. Based on two independent criteria, loss of hydraulic conductivity and proportions of gas-and liquid-filled vessels in cryo-scanning electron microscope (cryo-SEM) images , the xylem of R. mangle plants growing at the estuarine site was found to be more vulnerable to cavitation than that of plants growing at the coastal site. However, the cryo-SEM analyses suggested that cavitation occurred more readily in intact plants than in excised branches that were air-dried in the laboratory. Cryo-SEM analyses also revealed that, in both sites, the proportion of gas-filled vessels was 20-30{\%} greater at midday than at dawn or during the late afternoon. Refilling of cavitated vessels thus occurred during the late afternoon when considerable tension was present in neighboring vessels. These results and results from pressure-volume relationships suggest that R. mangle adjusts hydraulic properties of the water-transport system, as well as the leaf osmotic potential , in concert with the environmental growing conditions .},

abstract = {Trees species in the mangrove genus Avicennia can shed canopy parts when exposed to adverse environmental conditions, such as increases in porewater salinity. The individual-based model BETTINA enables the quantification of the tree's water use depending on its allometric characteristics. It thus provides a tool to model the equilibrium between plant size and density in a mangrove stand and porewater salinity. When the model is coupled with a simple water balance approach, the water use of trees corresponds to water uptake from the soil and, in combination with water fluxes, an increase of salinity in the root zone. Annual variations of the sea level, the tidal regime, groundwater inflow, and precipitation have an impact on the equilibrium of the combined system. Higher salinities lead to lower potential gradients and reduced water uptake of the plant. With a combined modelling approach (single tree model BETTINA with a simple water balance approach), we examined the dampening effects of consecutive partial canopy loss for the survival of the tree. We found that (i) the tree is able to decrease water demand and uptake and thus may reduce the tree's effect on soil water salinity, (ii) the reduced branch length leads to a reduced xylem flow resistance, and (iii) the reduction in height has a small positive effect on the water potential gradient between leaves and soil. Individual-based models can enhance our understanding of the regulating impact of the partial canopy loss on water balance in the combined plant-soil system.},

abstract = {Salinization, a widespread threat to the structure and ecological functioning of inland and coastal wetlands, is currently occurring at an unprecedented rate and geographic scale. The causes of salinization are diverse and include alterations to freshwater flows, land-clearance, irrigation, disposal of wastewater effluent, sea level rise, storm surges, and applications of de-icing salts. Climate change and anthropogenic modifications to the hydrologic cycle are expected to further increase the extent and severity of wetland salinization. Salinization alters the fundamental physicochemical nature of the soil-water environment, increasing ionic concentrations and altering chemical equilibria and mineral solubility. Increased concentrations of solutes, especially sulfate, alter the biogeochemical cycling of major elements including carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, sulfur, iron, and silica. The effects of salinization on wetland biogeochemistry typically include decreased inorganic nitrogen removal (with implications for water quality and climate regulation), decreased carbon storage (with implications for climate regulation and wetland accretion), and increased generation of toxic sulfides (with implications for nutrient cycling and the health/functioning of wetland biota). Indeed, increased salt and sulfide concentrations induce physiological stress in wetland biota and ultimately can result in large shifts in wetland communities and their associated ecosystem functions. The productivity and composition of freshwater species assemblages will be highly altered, and there is a high potential for the disruption of existing interspecific interactions. Although there is a wealth of information on how salinization impacts individual ecosystem components, relatively few studies have addressed the complex and often non-linear feedbacks that determine ecosystem-scale responses or considered how wetland salinization will affect landscape-level processes. Although the salinization of wetlands may be unavoidable in many cases, these systems may also prove to be a fertile testing ground for broader ecological theories including (but not limited to): investigations into alternative stable states and tipping points, trophic cascades, disturbance-recovery processes, and the role of historical events and landscape context in driving community response to disturbance.},

abstract = {Salinity is known to affect plant productivity by limiting leaf-level carbon exchange, root water uptake, and carbohydrates transport in the phloem. However, the mechanisms through which plants respond to salt exposure by adjusting leaf gas exchange and xylem–phloem flow are still mostly unexplored. A physically based model coupling xylem, leaf, and phloem flows is here developed to explain different osmoregulation patterns across species. Hydraulic coupling is controlled by leaf water potential, $\psi$l, and determined under four different maximization hypotheses: water uptake (1), carbon assimilation (2), sucrose transport (3), or (4) profit function – i.e. carbon gain minus hydraulic risk. All four hypotheses assume that finite transpiration occurs, providing a further constraint on $\psi$l. With increasing salinity, the model captures different transpiration patterns observed in halophytes (nonmonotonic) and glycophytes (monotonically decreasing) by reproducing the species-specific strength of xylem–leaf–phloem coupling. Salt tolerance thus emerges as plant's capability of differentiating between salt- and drought-induced hydraulic risk, and to regulate internal flows and osmolytes accordingly. Results are shown to be consistent across optimization schemes (1–3) for both halophytes and glycophytes. In halophytes, however, profit-maximization (4) predicts systematically higher $\psi$l than (1–3), pointing to the need of an updated definition of hydraulic cost for halophytes under saline conditions.},

abstract = {Soil salinity affects plant transpiration and growth through two main pathways: the osmotic effect of salt in the soil (osmotic stress; analogous to water stress) and the toxic effect of salt within the plant (ionic stress; salt specific). However, the drastic and sudden reduction of transpiration exhibited by most species in response to an increase of salinity in the root zone is mainly associated with the osmotic phase, while ionic stress appears at a later time, causing the premature senescence of leaves and the reduction of the plant photosynthetic area. To better investigate the effects of salinity on plant-water relations, we introduce a parsimonious soil-plant-atmosphere continuum (SPAC) model accounting for both salt exclusion at the root level and osmoregulation—i.e., the adjustment of internal water potential in response to salt stress. The model is used to interpret a paradox observed in salt-tolerant species where transpiration is maximum at an intermediate value of salinity (CTr, max), and is lower in more fresh (C{\textless}CTr, max) and more saline (C{\textgreater}CTr, max) conditions. Such nonmonotonic transpiration-salt concentration (Tr-C)) patterns can be largely explained by plant osmoregulation, while the peak of transpiration at CTr, max tends to disappear over longer time scales, when ionic stress appears and morphological adaptations become predominant. Osmoregulation emerges here as a water-saving behavior similar to the strategies that xerophytes use to cope with aridity. The maximum of transpiration at CTr, max is thus the result of a trade-off between the enhancement of salt-tolerance and optimal carbon assimilation.},

The extent of this reduction is a function of vegetation salt tolerance and can result in highly species-specific controls on soil water budget and salinization levels. Despite their crucial role in regulating the hydrology of saline soils, the effects of salt tolerance on transpiration remain mostly unexplored. Here we propose a minimalist stochastic model of primary salinization which reproduces the hitherto overlooked feedback of salinity on the soil water balance and the active role of plant salt tolerance in modulating such an effect. We show that vegetation can exert significant control on leaching occurrence and soil salinization, thus imposing a species-specific upper limit, Cmax, to the concentration of soluble salts in the soil. Since Cmax increases with plant salt tolerance, salt-resilient species have the potential to sustain more saline conditions in the soil, eventually creating a favorable environment for their ecological success.},

abstract = {Salinity and periodic inundation are both known to have a major role in shaping the ecohydrology of mangroves through their controls on water uptake, photosynthesis, stomatal conductance, gas exchanges, and nutrient availability. Salinity, in particular, can be considered one of the main abiotic regulating factors for halophytes and salt-tolerant species, due to its influence on water use patterns and growth rate. Ecohydrological literature has rarely focused on the effects of salinity on plant transpiration, based on the fact that the terrestrial plants mostly thrive in low-saline, unsaturated soils where the role of osmotic potential can be considered negligible. However, the effect of salinity cannot be neglected in the case of tidal species like mangroves, which have to cope with hyperosmotic conditions and waterlogging. We introduce here a first-order ecohydrological model of the soil/plant-atmosphere continuum of Avicennia marina—also known as gray mangrove—a highly salt-tolerant pioneer species able to adapt to hyperarid intertidal zones and characterized by unique morphological and ecophysiological traits. The A. marina's soil-plant-atmosphere continuum takes explicitly into account the role of water head, osmotic water potential, and water salinity in governing plant water fluxes. A. marina's transpiration is thus modeled as a function of salinity based on a simple parameterization of salt exclusion mechanisms at the root level and a modified Jarvis' expression accounting for the effects of salinity on stomatal conductance. Consistently with previous studies investigating the physiology of mangroves in response to different environmental drivers, our results highlight the major influence of salinity on mangrove transpiration when contrasted with other potential stressors such as waterlogging and water stress.},

Along Florida's coast, SLR and large-scale drying are increasing groundwater salinity, resulting in halophytic (salt-tolerant) species colonizing glycophytic (salt-intolerant) communities. We hypothesized that halophytes can contribute to increased soil salinity as they move into glycophyte communities, making soils more saline than SLR or drying alone. We tested our hypothesis with a replacement-series greenhouse experiment with halophyte/glycophyte ratios of 0:4, 1:3, 2:2, 3:1, 4:0, mimicking halophyte movement into glycophyte communities. We subjected replicates to 0, 26, and 38‰ salinity for one, one, and three months, respectively, taking soil salinity and stomatal conductance measurements at the end of each treatment period. Our results showed that soil salinity increased as halophyte/glycophyte ratio increased. Either osmotic or ionic stress caused decreases in glycophyte biomass, resulting in less per-plant transpiration as compared to halophytes. At 38‰ groundwater, soil salinity increased as halophyte density increased, making conditions more conducive to further halophyte establishment. This study suggests that coastal plant community turnover may occur faster than would be predicted from SLR and anthropogenic disturbance alone.},

The present study was conducted at 3 locations (northern, middle and southern), using 7 sites and 21 stands of mangrove forests (A. marina) along ∼1134 km of the Red Sea coastline of Saudi Arabia (from Duba in the north to Jazan in the south), all of which are in an arid climate.

On the other hand, the second axis was negatively correlated with total N, total P, EC and TDS. The SOC pools at the northern (10.5 kg C m−2) and southern locations (10.4 kg C m−2) were significantly higher than the SOC pool at the middle location (6.7 kg C m−2). In addition, the average CSR of the northern (5.9 g C m−2 yr−1) and southern locations (6.0 g C m−2 yr−1) were significantly higher than they were in the middle location (5.0 g C m−2 yr−1).},

In the present study, surface water salinity data from 13 rivers of the Sundarbans were collected in order to investigate the saline water intrusion in the mangrove wetlands. Results demonstrate that saline water has penetrated the upstream area as river water salinity has increased significantly in 1976 compared to the year 1968. The soil and river water salinity data also shows that it has crossed the water salinity threshold line in most parts of the Sundarbans wetlands.

We develop a modular tool which dynamically couples an agent-based vegetation model to a continuum groundwater model. The vegetation model describes individual trees and their interactions within their environment and communities. We show the dependence of the salinity distribution on aquifer properties within stylized case studies. Moreover, the model predicts varying tree allometries depending on variations of subsurface properties. Finally, we analyze the nature of belowground competition for fresh water as a direct consequence of the plant-soil feedback that is inherent to the modelling approach. The results show that the interaction of vegetation and subsurface hydrodynamics is crucial for vegetation zonation patterning in form of a pronounced distribution of tree allometry. We also discuss the benefits and disadvantages of our presented plant-soil feedback modelling approach, as well as its implications for future research.},

abstract = {Changes in mangal area were quantified in the eastern Exmouth Gulf over six years (1999-2004) after Cyclone Vance using Landsat TM satellite imagery and aerial photography. Vance was the strongest tropical cyclone ever to impact the Australian mainland before 2006 and produced wind gusts of more than 280 km h-1. Image data were processed using ENVI™ and IDRISI™ software. Three sets of Landsat TM images from 1999 (a few days before the cyclone), 2002 and 2004 were used, along with 2004 digital aerial photography. A 'common' subset of 904 km2 was selected from all images and classification was developed using ISODATA™ unsupervised classification to identify spectrally distinct areas followed by principal component analysis (PCA), vegetation indices and supervised classification. Some 12,800 ha of mangrove habitat was present before the cyclone and approximately 5700 ha (44{\%}) was removed by it. Most mangroves lost (74{\%}) between 1999 and 2004 were converted either to bare sediment or to live saltmarshes and this occurred mostly between 1999 and 2002. Five basic categories of damage were conspicuous from imagery and field observations, and evidence suggests that much of the loss was due to the longer term consequences of sediment deposition or smothering, rather than the immediate effects of wind or waves. Mangroves exhibited accelerated recovery between 2002 and 2004, and around 1580 ha regenerated during this time, amounting to a return of 68{\%} of their former coverage. At this recovery rate we estimate that they should have returned to their pre-cyclone area by 2009. Over half of the saltmarsh habitats (54{\%}) were removed by the cyclone (4060 ha) but their recovery has been far more rapid than mangroves. After 5 years, saltmarshes had returned to 87{\%} of their previous area. The 5700 ha of mangrove habitat damaged by Cyclone Vance exceeds any anthropogenic impact that has ever taken place in Western Australia by several orders of magnitude. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

The basic SRR fits the data well with the exception of 2 out of the 14 years when particularly severe cyclones occurred. This has been taken into account by using multiple regression techniques to incorporate the amount of rainfall in January and February as variables representing indices of cyclone activity (multiple correlation of 0-97). An hypothesis for the observed positive and negative effects of cyclones on recruit survival has been presented. The relationship between autumn recruitment and resultant spring spawning stock (RSR) later that year and the effects of fishing, measured in effective effort units, has also been established (multiple correlation of 0-94). An examination of the interaction between the SRR and RSR relationships has been reported which suggests that, under average environmental conditions and high levels of effort, recruitment will move towards a new lower equilibrium level. The robustness of the relationships with respect to assumptions involved and potential sources of bias in the variables used have been evaluated and discussed. {\textcopyright} 1986 CSIRO.

abstract = {Exmouth Gulf is a shallow (mean depth 11.9m, 2600 km2 area) inverse estuarine embayment on the northwest shelf of Australia, with a catchment area of 6400 km2 with low human and livestock populations in an arid climate. The Gulf is an extreme example of a tide and wave dominated estuary, with very small river inputs. Freshwater supply from the land is very small, and terrestrial run-off nutrient supply is estimated to be 0.8 mmol TN and 0.4 mmol TP per square metre Gulf area per year (TN=total dissolved and particulate nitrogen, TP=total dissolved and particulate phosphorus). Holocene deposits in the mangrove margins are less than 1 m thick, and are relict and partly aeolian in origin. Surficial sediments are largely quartz and calcite sand, and fine-grained recent sediments are probably removed by energetic Indian Ocean tide and wave mixing and circulation. Geochemical variations in sediment composition across the Gulf are small, and appear to be little affected by redox cycles. Marine organic matter is efficiently decomposed, leaving behind excess phosphorus associated with carbonate and iron-rich sediments. The thin ribbon of stunted mangroves along the eastern margin of the Gulf has little influence on the composition of sedimentary organic matter in the Gulf, and the mangrove sediments are not a trap for trace elements as has been found in other parts of the tropical world. Ba, Li, Pb, and Cu vary in direct proportion to the abundance of the bulk sediment aluminosilicate fraction, boron is enriched by evaporation in the supratidal saltflat regions, and cadmium has large variations perhaps related to the carbonate fraction of the sediments. There is little evidence for coastal trapping of sediment and oceanic elements in Exmouth Gulf, and some regions of the intertidal mangrove and saltflat zones are being eroded into the Gulf and adjacent shelf. {\textcopyright} 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Tropical cyclones can be devastating to ecosystems, but they can also result in pulses of fresh water and sediments delivered in floodwaters to the coastal zone. In the arid zone the pulses provided by cyclones may be particularly important for the maintenance of productivity. We examined the impacts of Cyclone Pancho on growth and nutrient limitations to growth in mangroves on the arid coast of Western Australia. We found that growth of trees was enhanced after the cyclone, more than doubling their rates of stem extension. Fertilisation studies showed that before the cyclone tree growth was nutrient limited. After the cyclone fertilisation treatments had no significant effect on growth, indicating nutrients had been delivered during the storm. Additionally, before the cyclone the efficiency of resorption of phosphorus and nitrogen from senescent leaves was higher than after the cyclone, suggesting that nutrient availability was enhanced. Analysis of stable isotopes of leaf tissue indicated that the cyclone was associated with small changes in water use efficiency, consistent with decreased soil salinity associated with the cyclone. There was, however, significant reductions in $\delta$15N indicating enhanced N supply potentially from a new source. We conclude that in the arid zone, floodwater associated with cyclones is important for the delivery of nutrient subsidies that stimulate mangrove growth and that predicted future reductions in the frequency of cyclones will have negative impacts on the productivity of these ecosystems.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {Strip-transect aerial surveys of Shark Bay. Ningaloo Reef and Exmouth Gulf were conducted during the winters of 1989 and 1994. These surveys were designed primarily to estimate the abundance and distribution of dugongs, although they also allowed sea turtles and dolphins, and, to a lesser extent, whales, manta rays and whale sharks to be surveyed. Shark Bay contains a large population of dugongs that is of international significance. Estimates of approximately 10000 dugongs resulted from both surveys. The density of dugongs is the highest recorded in Australia and the Middle East, where these surveys have been conducted. Exmouth Gulf and Ningaloo Reef are also important dugong habitats, each supporting in the order of 1000 dugongs. The estimated number of turtles in Shark Bay is comparable to the number in Exmouth Gulf plus Ningaloo Reef (7000-9000). The density of turtles in Ningaloo Reef and, to a lesser extent, Exmouth Gulf is exceptionally high compared with most other areas that have been surveyed by the same technique. Shark Bay supports a substantial population of bottlenose dolphins (2000-3000 minimum estimate). Exmouth Gulf and Ningaloo Reef were not significant habitats for dolphins during the winter surveys. Substantial numbers of whales (primarily humpbacks) and manta rays occur in northern and western Shark Bay in winter. Ningaloo Reef is an important area for whale sharks and manta rays in autumn and winter. The Shark Bay Marine Park excludes much of the winter habitats of the large vertebrate fauna of Shark Bay. In 1989 and 1994, more than half of all the dugongs were seen outside the Marine Park (57.4 and 50.7{\%}, respectively). Approximately one-third to one-half of turtles and dolphins were seen outside the Marine Park (in 1989 and 1994 respectively: turtles, 43 and 27{\%}; dolphins, 47 and 32{\%}). Almost all the whales and most of the manta rays were seen outside the Marine Park. Expansion of the Shark Bay Marine Park, to bring it into alignment with the marine section of the Shark Bay World Heritage Area, would facilitate the appropriate management of these populations. This would also simplify the State-Commonwealth collaboration necessary to meet the obligations of World Heritage listing. The coastal waters of Western Australia north of the surveyed area (over 6000 km of coastline) are relatively poorly known and surveys of their marine megafauna are required for wise planning and management.},

abstract = {The cover of seagrasses and macroalgae, landings and fishery-independent measures of spawning stock and recruitment for brown tiger prawns, were monitored immediately following a major cyclone in Exmouth Gulf, Western Australia in March 1999. Anecdotal evidence on the extent of seagrass from 1990 to 1998 suggests that the cyclone caused a major, immediate disruption and loss of the seagrass/macroalgal beds (to ≤2{\%} cover), the critical prawn nursery habitat, and mangroves in the shallow inshore waters of the system. Prawn landings and recruitment to the fishery were not affected in the year of thecyclone, but were markedly lower in the two years immediately afterwards and then increased as thecover of macrophytes increased to over 40{\%} in 2003. Tiger prawn landings and catch rates were notaffected in Shark Bay, a system 500km south of Exmouth Gulf that did not experience cyclonic disturbance. Seagrasses in Exmouth Gulf showed a succession of species from small colonising species(Halophila ovalis and Halodule uninervis) to larger, broad-leaved species (Cymodocea serrulata, Syringodium isoetifolium) only two years after the cyclone. The recruitment and landings of tiger prawns were correlated significantly with the total cover of macroalgae and seagrass. The large loss of seagrass and macroalgae reduced the settling habitat for postlarvae and the nursery habitat for juvenile tiger prawns, probably leading to the lower recruitment to the fishery. These findings suggest that the extent of seagrass and macroalgae are some of the factors defining the productivity of the tiger prawn fishery in Exmouth Gulf. {\textcopyright} 2013 The Authors.},

abstract = {Nutrient enrichment of the coastal zone places intense pressure on marine communities. Previous studies have shown that growth of intertidal mangrove forests is accelerated with enhanced nutrient availability. However, nutrient enrichment favours growth of shoots relative to roots, thus enhancing growth rates but increasing vulnerability to environmental stresses that adversely affect plant water relations. Two such stresses are high salinity and low humidity, both of which require greater investment in roots to meet the demands for water by the shoots. Here we present data from a global network of sites that documents enhanced mortality of mangroves with experimental nutrient enrichment at sites where high sediment salinity was coincident with low rainfall and low humidity. Thus the benefits of increased mangrove growth in response to coastal eutrophication is offset by the costs of decreased resilience due to mortality during drought, with mortality increasing with soil water salinity along climatic gradients. {\textcopyright} 2009 Lovelock et al.},

abstract = {This paper reports problems associated to the use of the Point-Centred Quarter Method (PCQM), as well as their possible solutions. Problematic settings in the application of the PCQM are amongst others due to the presence of multiple-stemmed trees (MST), to ambiguous settings for measuring the sampling point to nearest tree distance or the tree diameter, both of which may result in erroneous estimation of silvimetric variables and parameters. The analysis is based on a database of effective individual tree records including distances, diameters, and heights measured in the field in a Sri Lankan mangrove forest between 1997 and 2002, and randomly compiles a series of records that were used as PCQM sampling points. Various structural forest parameters were calculated, with particular emphasis on density and basal area. After proving that multiple- and single-stemmed trees have different silvimetric characteristics, we adopted an empirical approach to demonstrate the classical PCQM protocol applied to MST generates significantly different densities (overestimation) and basal areas (underestimation) depending on which stems are considered for measurement, and we suggest an adapted PCQM+ protocol (measurement of central stem instead of nearest stem). We test both protocols in two mangrove assemblages (one composed of Excoecaria agallocha only, and an Excoecaria agallocha/Rhizophora apiculata mixed forest) with MST proportions varying between 0{\%} and 100{\%}, at 5{\%} intervals. The results indicated that the classical PCQM protocol generates density and basal area results that are strongly correlated with the MST proportion in the assemblage (p {\textless} 0.001), whereas the PCQM+ protocol shows a robustness with no such correlations for density. For basal area the results of the PCQM+ protocol showed a weak correlation with the MST proportion, and regression-ANCOVA results indicated that they were significantly different from those of the highly sensitive PCQM protocol (p {\textless} 0.001). Finally, we conclude by writing out the entire PCQM+ protocol, elaborating on the solutions to other common problems related to ambiguous settings for the consideration of stems or the measurement of their diameter (aerial roots, split trunks, dwarf growth, horizontally developing stems, boundary of an individual in MST, selectively cut trees or tree parts, very sparse assemblages, use of PCQM for remote sensing ground-truth), and by nevertheless highlighting the potential of the PCQM/PCQM+ approach. Although we used a mangrove forest data set, the PCQ-Method and our suggestions are widely applicable to other forest types.

abstract = {Metabolic scaling theory (MST) predicts a 'universal scaling law' for plant mass-density relationships, but empirical observations are more variable. Possible explanations of this variability include plasticity in biomass allocation between the above- and belowground compartment and different modes of competition, which can be asymmetric or symmetric. Although complex interactions of these factors are likely to occur, so far the majority of modelling and empirical studies has focussed on mono-factorial explanations. We here present a generic individual-based model, which allows exploring the plant mass-density relationship in realistic settings by representing plasticity of biomass allocation and different modes of competition in the above- and belowground compartment. Plants grew according to an ontogenetic growth model derived from MST. To evaluate the behavior of the simulated plants related to the allocation patterns and to validate model predictions, we conducted greenhouse experiments with tree seedlings. The model reproduced empirical patterns both at the individual and population level. Without belowground resource limitation, aboveground processes dominated and the slopes of mass-density relationships followed the predictions of MST. In contrast, resource limitation led to an increased allocation of biomass to belowground parts of the plants. The subsequent dominance of symmetric belowground competition caused significantly shallower slopes of the mass-density relationship, even though the growth of individual plants followed MST. We conclude that changes in biomass allocation induced by belowground resource limitation explain the deviations from the mass-density relationship predicted by MST. Taking into account the plasticity of biomass allocation and its linkage to the above- and belowground competition is critical for fully representing plant communities, in particular for correctly predicting their response of carbon storage and sequestration to changing environmental conditions. {\textcopyright} 2013 The Authors.},

abstract = {Due to limited availability of surface water, many arid to semi-arid countries rely on their groundwater resources. Despite the quasi-absence of present day replenishment, some of these groundwater bodies contain large amounts of water, which was recharged during pluvial periods of the Late Pleistocene to Early Holocene. These mostly fossil, non-renewable resources require different management schemes compared to those which are usually applied in renewable systems. Fossil groundwater is a finite resource and its withdrawal implies mining of aquifer storage reserves. Although they receive almost no recharge, some of them show notable hydraulic gradients and a flow towards their discharge areas, even without pumping. As a result, these systems have more discharge than recharge and hence are not in steady state, which makes their modelling, in particular the calibration, very challenging. In this study, we introduce a new calibration approach, composed of four steps: (i) estimating the fossil discharge component, (ii) determining the origin of fossil discharge, (iii) fitting the hydraulic conductivity with a pseudo steady-state model, and (iv) fitting the storage capacity with a transient model by reconstructing head drawdown induced by pumping activities. Finally, we test the relevance of our approach and evaluated the effect of considering or ignoring fossil gradients on aquifer parameterization for the Upper Mega Aquifer (UMA) on the Arabian Peninsula.},

However, transient remediation mechanisms and impact of parameters are still unsatisfyingly understood. Therefore, the feasibility and optimal management of mixed hydraulic barriers as well as a comparison to single positive and negative barriers are explored with a synthetic 2D variable-density model of an already salinated, unconfined coastal aquifer using SEAWAT and FloPy. The hydraulic conductivity, porosity, injection and extraction rate, barrier locations, injection salt concentration, and reduction of pumping stress are varied jointly to determine the parameters' impact and interdependencies. The hydraulic conductivity controls the overall remediation potential as a hydrogeological component. Reduced inland abstractions of supply wells and the injection rates of the positive barrier show the largest remediation effects. However, locating the positive barrier within the salt wedge poses the risk of trapping salt landside. A sole negative barrier did not improve remediation substantially. This study thus shows that remediation with mixed hydraulic barriers can be feasible if implemented according to local conditions.},

abstract = {Crown displacement in trees is an adaptive response driven by neighbours that optimizes space use and reduces competition. But it can also be the result of wind force. Although morphological responses to neighbours have been well studied, the interplay between neighbours and wind in driving crown shape, and the implications for plant interactions remain poorly understood. However, it is crucial to predict such changes in vegetation structure and function under the scope of global change. We test the hypothesis that aboveground interactions are reduced with increasing soil stress and that wind becomes the main driver of crown shape in mangrove forests. We investigated the effect of neighbours and wind intensity and direction on crown displacement of mangrove canopy and below canopy trees along a salinity gradient, and assessed crown asymmetry for three mangrove tree species, as well as the contribution of crown displacement on reducing crown-projected area overlap and thus neighbourhood competition. Results show that crown displacement of canopy trees is strongly influenced by winds at all salinities. At low salinities, competition for space accounted for 48{\%} of crown displacement away from neighbours, compared to 49{\%} found for the synthetized effects of wind and neighbours. While trees below the canopy displace their crowns away from their neighbours, no response to wind could be detected. This can be due to the wind protection conferred by a dense canopy stand related to bigger crowns that effectively reduce wind drag. At higher salinities, there was a reduction in canopy overlap due to crown displacement, which suggests reduced aboveground plant interactions with increasing soil stress. While neighbourhood avoidance is a fundamental strategy for optimal light foraging, this study shows that wind strength and directionality are main drivers of crown shape with increasing stress and highlights their potential influence in plant interactions and forest structure, pointing to an increased susceptibility of trees to disturbances that should be further studied. A plain language summary is available for this article.},

Although stem water isotopic signatures were most similar to porewater, variation in isotopic values indicated trees also accessed alternative water sources, the degree to which varied over sites and among species. Rhizophora stylosa had lowest values of stable isotopes among the species indicating significant groundwater utilization. In a long-term fertilization experiment we found that growth of Ceriops australis and Lumnitzera racemosa was nitrogen limited, while growth of R. stylosa was nitrogen limited to a lesser extent, suggesting groundwater may also provide nutritional benefits for R. stylosa. The uptake of alternative water sources in addition to saline porewater may improve metabolic function, differentially altering the performance of different species and over sites.},

In s u b h u m i d regions with rainfall {\textgreater}1 000 m m / y r mangals have 12 species which are recurring and c o m m o n. The climate becomes more arid southwards and species richness decreases: 8 species are c o m m o n in mangals in semiarid regions and 5 species are c o m m o n in arid regions. Rainfall influences the distribution of species across tidal flats because of direct recharge to g r o u n d w a t e r systems and also because of subsurface seepage along the hinterland edge. M u c h of the increase in species diversity is located along high parts of tidal flats and along the edge of the hinterland. At the local level s t r a t i g r a p h y forms an i m p o r t a n t part of the h y d r o l o g y by determining the distribution of aquifers and aquacludes. Fresh water seeps into the tidal lands via buried, discrete aquifers and dilutes the highly hypersaline g r o u n d w a t e r. M a n g r o v e s inhabit these local areas above the less saline groundwater. The influence of rainfall and freshwater seepage on mangals is presented as a unifying theme which helps to explain distribution and diversity of mangroves at both a regional and local level.},

The crystal is modelled as a nonlinear elastic material, with a free-energy function that is invariant with respect to both rigid-body rotations and the appropriate crystallographic symmetries. The predictions concern primarily the two-well problem, that of determining all possible energy-minimizing deformations that can be obtained with two coherent and macroscopically unstressed variants of martensite. The set of possible macroscopic deformations obtained is completely determined by the lattice parameters of the material. For certain boundary conditions the total free energy does not attain a minimum, and the finer and finer oscillations of minimizing sequences are interpreted as corresponding to microstructure. The predictions are amenable to experimental tests. The proposed tests involve the comparison of the theoretical predictions with the mechanical response of properly oriented plates subject to simple shear. Additional crystallographic background is given for the model, and the theory is compared with the {\{}$\backslash$textquoteleft{\}}linearized{\{}$\backslash$textquoteright{\}} model of Khachaturyan, Roitburd and Shatalov.

Although mangroves are highly adapted to saline environments, maintaining water uptake under saline conditions is energetically expensive. Therefore, salinity is a limiting factor for mangrove growth and productivity, and access to fresh water sources, such as rainwater and groundwater, which reduce water salinity, increase mangrove ecosystem productivity. Here, we investigated the extent of fresh water utilization by mangroves to better predict current and future mangrove productivity. We used the abundance of 18O isotope in stem water to assess: (1) the extent of fresh water utilization by Avicennia marina (Forssk.) Vierh across hydrological settings; and (2) whether growth, measured as increments in stem circumference, is sensitive to variation in rainfall availability. The $\delta$18O isotopic composition of stem water indicated mangroves use both fresh and saline water sources for metabolic processes. However, our results suggest that the proportion of fresh water used by mangroves increases with the availability of fresh water. Growth of the main stems of trees was correlated with rainfall (r2 = 0.34 and r2 = 0.37, P = 0.001). Our results indicate that access to fresh water is important for mangrove productivity because it enhances their growth rates.},

abstract = {Abstract The upper and lower limits of the distribution of mature Avicennia marina lie between mean high water and mean sea level in open estuaries in southeastern Australia. Newly established seedlings are highly variable in abundance, but are rarely found in the saltmarsh or on mudflats. Their distribution is unlikely to be limited by dispersal because propagules disperse into the saltmarsh and to intertidal mudflats, but their establishment may be limited by physicochemical conditions, interspecific competition and predation. The model that physicochemical conditions control the intertidal limits of establishment of seedlings was accepted for propagules stranding in the saltmarsh but rejected for those stranding on mudflats. No seedlings established on saltmarsh sediments but similar numbers of seedlings established within light gaps in adult mangrove stands and on intertidal mudflats. The model that interspecific interaction with freeliving macroalgae (Hormosira banksii) reduces the establishment of seedlings on mudflats covered with macroalgae or in stands with a ground cover of macroalgae was accepted. Under controlled conditions five times as many propagules established on cleared ground compared with ground covered with macroalgae. Predators also reduce seedling establishment, but the model that they preferentially act on propagules stranding on the mudflat was rejected. The low number of seedlings found on mudflats without macroalgae appears to relate to wave and current effects on establishment and the effects of waterlogging or fouling on survival.

abstract = {Mangrove forests are rapidly expanding their distribution in New Zealand, which is at the southern limit of their range. We investigated how these expanding mangrove forests develop through time. We assessed patterns in forest structure and function at the Firth of Thames, which is a rapidly accreting mangrove site in New Zealand where 1 km of mangrove of Avicennia marina has established seaward since the 1950s. Across the intertidal region, mangrove forest structure was highly variable. We used bomb-pulse radiocarbon dating to age the forest. Two major forest establishment events were identified; one in 1978-1981 and another in 1991-1995. These events coincided with sustained El Ni{\~{n}}o activity and are likely the result of reduced wind and wave energy at the site during these periods. We used the two forests of different ages to assess whether mangroves in New Zealand mature at similar rates as other mangroves and whether they conform to classic models of succession. The timing of forest maturation is similar in New Zealand as in more tropical locations with trees exhibiting features of mature forests as they age from about 10 to about 30 years. In older forest ({\~{}}30 years old) trees become larger and stands more homogenous than in the younger forest ({\~{}}10 years old). Carbon and nutrient concentrations in soils increased and soils become more aerobic in older forest compared to younger forest. Additionally, using fertilization experiments, we established that despite reduced growth rates in older forests, nitrogen remained limiting to growth in both older and young forests. However, in contrast to classic successional models leaf tissue nutrient concentrations and nutrient conservation (nutrient resorption from senescence leaf tissue) were similar in forests of differing ages and did not vary with fertilization. We conclude that mangrove forest expansion in New Zealand is influenced by climatic factors. Mangrove forests mature rapidly, even at the limits of their range and they satisfy many of the successional patterns predicted by Odum (1969) for the early stages of forest succession. {\textcopyright} 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

Variations in the structure and function of mangrove ecosystems have generally been described solely on the basis of a hierarchical classification of the physical characteristics of the intertidal environment, including climate, geomorphology, topography, and hydrology. Here, we use the concept of emergent properties at multiple levels within a hierarchical framework to review how the interplay between specialized adaptations and extreme trait plasticity that characterizes mangroves and intertidal environments gives rise to the biocomplexity that distinguishes mangrove ecosystems. The traits that allow mangroves to tolerate variable salinity, flooding, and nutrient availability influence ecosystem processes and ultimately the services they provide. We conclude that an integrated research strategy using emergent properties in empirical and theoretical studies provides a holistic approach for understanding and managing mangrove ecosystems. {\textcopyright} 2010 by Annual Reviews.},

Comparison of the results above 0.8 m and below 0.8 m showed that as depth increases, the concentrations become more homogeneous.

The largest simulated climate changes are due to the radiative influence of CO2, modified slightly by vegetation feedbacks. Annual precipitation increases by about 20{\%} in coastal areas of northern China and in central China, but only by 8{\%} in southern China. The strongest warming of up to 4°C occurs in summer in northern China. Generally, the climate tends to be warmer and wetter under doubled CO2 except for inland areas of northern China, where it becomes warmer and drier. Most of the changes discussed in this paper are associated with changes in the East Asian monsoon, which is intensified under doubled CO2.

abstract = {The scaling exponent of the biomass-density relationship of even-aged plant populations – often described as the slope of the self-thinning line - and its presumed universality has been a subject of debate for a long time. Comprehensive observational studies, mainly in the last century, yielded even shifting slopes, for which, until now, the theoretical basis was not fully clarified. With a new mechanistic individual-based plant growth model, the BETTINA{\_}ibm that considered allometric adaptation to resource supply, we identified two regimes of the self-thinning process: (i) The Geometrical thinning, which is driven by the ground area occupied by individual plants. For this, the slope is controlled by the allometric relations of the plant and thus roughly fitting the −3/2 power law. Age dependent processes impacting the allometry (e.g., secondary girth growth) result in a deviation from the original geometrical assumptions, and this may alter the slope accordingly. The intercept depends on species-specific allometric relations, site characteristics and the competition mode. (ii) The Maximum maintainable biomass per ground area, for which, if reached, the slope is −1. The intercept depends on resource supply (light and below-ground resources), as derived by the logarithm of the maximum total volume per area. The actual self-thinning line follows the minimum of both lines, and it is capped by the maximum individual plant size. Depending on the intercepts of (i) and (ii), the slope of the self-thinning line may be controlled by (i) geometrical thinning, (ii) resource limitation, or a switch between both. These two regimes and the shift from one to the other comply with experimental observations from the literature. Overall, morphological plasticity explains the variability of the slope of the self-thinning line when geometrical thinning is dominating.},

@article{Berger2000,
abstract = {This paper presents a new approach to spatially explicit modelling that enables the influence of neighbourhood effects on the dynamics of forests and plant communities to be analysed. We refer to this approach as ‘field of neighbourhood' (FON). It combines the ‘neighbourhood philosophy' of grid-based models with the description of individual spacing in the ‘zone of influence' (ZOI) approach. The novel feature of FON is that modelling of local competition between neighbouring trees is based on the notion of a field of neighbourhood exerted by each tree. This field is defined only on the ZOI of a tree and depends on the distance to the stemming point. For the demonstration of FON's power, a simulation model (KiWi) was implemented that focuses on the dynamic of mangrove forests. The realistic self-thinning behaviour of modelled stands of Avicennia germinans and Rhizophora mangle confirms the suitability of the FON approach for the description of intra- and inter-specific competition. In KiWi, mortality is modelled in terms of a ‘memory function', i.e. the yearly stem increment of each tree is stored in its ‘memory' over a certain time period and determines — as a sign of vitality — tree mortality. The results of KiWi demonstrate that this description is sufficient to keep the maximum age of the trees within a reasonable limit. The model thus manages without a description of individual tree age. This is an important feature considering the fact that a direct relationship between tree age and mortality is questioned and there is no established method as yet for determining the age of mangrove trees.},

abstract = {This paper deals with numerical modeling of density-dependent flow of saltwater intrusion in coastal groundwater systems. We present the implementation of an approach to solve a moving boundary problem for a dynamic water table within an invariant finite element mesh. The model is successfully validated against laboratory experiment data for an unconfined, density-dependent benchmark. The validated software is applied to a regional-scale study area and sufficiently calibrated for a steady state of pre-development conditions. Transient mass transport scenario simulations show good concordance with salinity measurements satisfyingly supporting the model setup.},
